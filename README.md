JavaScript Starter Kit
======================

JavaScript is amazing.

It is a powerful, simple, infuriating, elegant and sometimes irrational programming language which was born in a hurry and can now do almost anything you can imagine. It can make whizzy websites, speak to databases, and draw maps, it can fly drones, make games, and build apps. You can run it on your watch or on your phone, on any web page or on hundreds of virtual servers.

And if you're reading this you're probably contemplating learning it.

This day-long workshop aims to cover enough ground to give you a broad base from which to start your quest. We'll use plenty of practical exercises to  explore the language. We'll cover some of the tricky parts which often mystify people - especially handling asynchronous code, which is one of the language's great strengths. We'll spend most of our time in the browser, but we'll also play around with node.js, JavaScript's foremost server-side environment. There'll be time to survey some of the different tools and frameworks which are popular with JavaScripters at the moment. As well as all this we'll explore JavaScript's history, its culture and community, and the factors behind its explosive growth. Perhaps most importantly we'll introduce a set of resources which'll help you continue your learning independently.

You'll need to come equipped with a laptop, and you should have a modern browser installed, along with a text editor you're comfortable using. You don't need to have a lot of knowledge or experience to join in, though any familiarity with another programming language will help a lot.
